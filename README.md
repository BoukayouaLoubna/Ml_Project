Book recommendation system

## Introduction

Recommendation systems are widely used today to recommend products to users based on their interests.
A recommendation system is one of the strongest systems for increasing profits by retaining more users in a very big competition.

## Objectifs

 A book recommendation system is designed to recommend books of interest to the buyer.
 
The purpose of a book recommendation system is to predict buyer’s interest and recommend books to them accordingly. 
 
A book recommendation system can take into account many parameters like book content and book quality by filtering user reviews.

## Data Exploration:shape analysis

### data understanding :
The dataset under consideration comprises comprehensive information about books,  and handling null values appropriately, we can ensure the integrity of the dataset and enhance the robustness of subsequent analyses.

## Data Exploration:background analysis

### data vesualisation:
-vesualisation the relation between feature avarage rating and  other features
-This comprehensive analysis will contributeinsights to refine our recommendation system.

## Data Preparation:

creating a categorical feature (avrage_parts)
encoding categorical variables as binary vectors
concatenate of data frames

## Modelling

- Data splitting: training and testing sets  
- Data normalization: Min-Max scaling method’s  
- Deploy the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest algorithm  
- Model Initialization  
- Model Fitting on the training set  
- Finding Nearest Neighbors on the testing set  

## Model evaluation

By emphasizing the similarity of features between a provided book and the recommended oens.

## conclusion

 the book recommendation system presented in this report serves as a foundation for personalized and engaging reading experiences, catering to the diverse tastes of a global audience.
